# STEGANOGRAPHY
 Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another medium. This project demonstrates how to hide a text message inside an image file using steganography techniques. The goal is to embed secret data in such a way that its presence is imperceptible to the human eye while maintaining the integrity of the original image.
